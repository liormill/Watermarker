# Watermarker
Picture Watermarker

I got a task to create python code to implement watermark in pictures.

The code for that is quite simple using PIL module, but then it can only be done through what I define in the code,
such as using specific .jpg file and defining the watermark text within the code.

I decided to elaborate it a little bit and create a tkinter platform for the user to choose the file and the watermark text,
and I got this.
